### Final Project

#### Project Description

As the economic recession is coming, the inflation rate is continuously growing. Consumers and their spending on groceries have been impacted greatly. The high inflation rate increases the food price, and at the same time, many companies are laying off employees or refusing to match salaries with inflation. It changes consumer spending behavior. Since food is a necessity, it is the first that is impacted. 

For this project, I am investigating the changes in consumer goods prices, especially food prices; and how that correlated with the inflation rate and consumer purchasing behavior. I gathered data from Commodity Price data from a database called Dataplanet. The data includes 45 food categories from 1996 to 2021. By analyzing the price trend, I will be able to gather the pattern of price changes in the different economic cycles. Moreover, I also gathered consumer spending per household data to analyze the relationship between price and spending. 

This story aims to interpret the consumer behavior pattern and how economic recession impact our daily life.
