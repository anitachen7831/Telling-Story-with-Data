This is P&G's 2022 annual report. The data visualization I selected is the shareholder return as compared to S&P 500 market index. There are three reasons why chosing this data, firstly, this is very important benchmark data to show the aggressive growing trend of P&G. Second, among all the information in the report, the shareholder return data is the key datapoints in determining the success of the company's performance. Lastly, the visualization layout and design is not emphaizing the growth, which is not benefiiting this positive information. 

## Step Two: critique the data visualization 

My overall observation of the graph is that it shows the general trend of shareholder return in 5 years is increasing. The chart does an efficient job of displaying the growth with the triangle sign, different color marks, and clear lines. However, the graph is not very useful in displaying the intent of the graph to compare P&G’s shareholder return, S&P 500 stock Index, and S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. The comparison insights are not very identical to the current visualization.    

The graph includes all relevant data points to make the comparison. It includes the overall 5 years of the cumulative value which display fully in the graph. The title makes it clear of the comparison and its context. Yet, what can be improved is the measures of norm and targets of the shareholder return to make the projected return and growth clear.    

The perceptibility of the graph is low. The presentation of the graph takes a lot of effort for the audience to perceive, match and understand different categories. Especially the indistinctive color and same triangle shape representation. It is inconvenient for the eye to move from the label information to the graph. The lines are also convoluted which leaves it difficult to interpret and compare. 
The data is reliable given that the data is coming from the professional financial resource. The presentation of the data is also pretty accurate with consistent dollar format, scale, and length. 

The choice of chart type in presenting the data is pretty intuitive. The line graph appears commonly in company reports to display the business trend. The 5-year range is also a standard in showing past data. The supplement table of data is also helpful for the reader to understand the percentage and gap. 
The aesthetics of the graph is not very appealing. First, it is not visually pleasing with the standard color and lines. There is the minimum design that is put into the chart. Second, considering the context of the annual report, the strength of the graph is the blue representation of P&G brand VI. The cons of the graph are the standard lines that don’t empathize with the branding. 

The engagement is not very in-depth without emphasis on the key information and insights of the P&G shareholder growth. The hue and saturation of color are not curated to tell the story between the three datasets either. 

## Step Three: sketch out the result
