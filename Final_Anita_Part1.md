## Final Project Part 1 Storyboard

### Project Description

As the economic recession is coming, the inflation rate is continuously growing. Consumers and their spending on groceries have been impacted greatly. The high inflation rate increases the food price, and at the same time, many companies are laying off employees or refusing to match salaries with inflation. It changes consumer spending behavior. Since food is a necessity, it is the first that is impacted. 

For this project, I am investigating the changes in consumer goods prices, especially food prices; and how that correlated with the inflation rate and consumer purchasing behavior. I gathered data from Commodity Price data from a database called Dataplanet. The data includes 45 food categories from 1996 to 2021. By analyzing the price trend, I will be able to gather the pattern of price changes in the different economic cycles. Moreover, I also gathered consumer spending per household data to analyze the relationship between price and spending. 

This story aims to interpret the consumer behavior pattern and how economic recession impact our daily life. 

### Outline 

##### Set Up 

Egg price has increases drastically. Before I spent about $3.99 for a dozen of eggs, now for the same product, I spent about $7.99. The price almost increases twice,likewise for other products. Ultimately, average spending on grocery is increasing. How does that impact our life?

##### Conflict 
Will the price decreses as the cycle goes alone? Is that a healthy economic cycle? Who is benefiting from this inflation? If consumer spending less in grocery, what are the main categories of spending? energy?

##### diagram 5 state distribution 

##### diagram 6 inflation rate v.s grocery price  
Is inflation rate the only factor that drives up the commondity price? What if the corporate takes advantages of consumers' expectation that there is a price growth, in that increase the price. 

##### Resolution 
According to previous cycle, when economic recession will end? There is still hope!

##### Data 

All the data is exported from DataPlanet Statistics. The first dataset is the Consumer Price Index from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) - 2021 Database, it consists of 45 food categories and prices from 1997 to 2021. Some of the data points were missing, but overall it shows the general trend. I will analyze the data by food categories, whether it is meat or vegetable, and whether the average price is cheap or expensive. The metric is defined by how consumers purchase the grocery in everyday life. I will also analyze the trend within each food category to identify which one changes the most.

The second dataset is the 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Inflation Indexed from the Interest Rates Database (USA 01/02/2003 - 11/21/2022). I will analyze the data by first drawing out the trend, and the second match with the commodity price to compare the pattern. The goal is to see whether there is a relationship and how will that change in the future.

##### Method and Medium 

I will first use Tableau to do data visualization and use Shorthand to create the story line of the topic. I will also make the presentation interactive and closely related to the audience's daily life.
