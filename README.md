# About me

### Introduction 
My name is Anita Chen, I am a second-year graduate student from Arts Managament Programï¼ŒHeniz College. I studied sculpture and art history in my undergrad and looking to pivot to management consulting upon graduation from Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in sharpening my data visualization skills to better narrate the story and recommendation for the clients. 

### Hobbies 
I like scuba diving and hiking. I also like traveling and cooking. 

# What I hope to learn
1. I hope to learn more about different tools for visual story telling. 
2. I want to develop creativity in drawing different graphs and working with different datasets. 
3. I also want to learn more about color theory and diverse types of Visualization. 
4. Tools to learn: I hope to sharpen my Tableau and Flourish skills.

### Assignment #2 Visualizing Government Debt

This assignment is about visualizing the government debt dataset that is drawn from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The goal is to use Flourish as a tool to efficiently visualize the dataset that best tells the story. I used a line chart, bar chart, and spike lines to visualize the dataset. I also tried to use the color tool and theory that we learned in class to make visually appealing and effective data visualization.

### Assignment #3 & #4 Data Visualization Critique

This assignment is about critiquing and recreating a data visualization by using Few, Stephen's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. I first chose the shareholder return v.s. market index in P&G's 2022 annual report. By using the Effectiveness Scale, I criticized the visualization using 7 metrics. Later, I started to sketch and brainstorm ways to optimize this dataset. After two rounds of interviews, I developed a new visualization to tell P&G's financial record effectively.

This process helps me to understand data visualization both from the reader's and designer's perspective to optimize the information, think about the audience, and emphasize specific insights.

### Final Project 
This is the presentation of final research and data visualization project at the end of the class. The research topic is about how the grocery food prices change over the past 10 years and how does consumer behaivor changes according to that (for example, per household spending).
