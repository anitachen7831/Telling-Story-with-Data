# About me

### Introduction 
My name is Anita Chen, I am a second-year graduate student from Arts Managament Program. I studied sculpture and art history in my undergrad and looking to pivot to management consulting after school. 

### Hobbies 
I like scuba diving and hiking. I also like traveling. I also like food and cooking. 

# What I hope to learn
1. I hope to learn more about different tools for visual story telling. 
2. I want to develop creativity in drawing different graphs and working with different datasets. 
3. I also want to learn more about color theory and types of Visualization.

#### Government Debt

#### Government Debt By Country 2000-2018 (version #1)

The graph shows the government debt from 2000 to 2018 of 24 countries. The source of the data is public and coming from OECD. The graph indicates the trend of the government debt over the past 8 years and compariosn among each other at different time period. The stacked line chart emphasizes the amount of debt that each country carries. 


#### Government Debt By Country 2000-2018 (version #2)

For the alternative data visualization, I chose Treemap to group the total government debt for each country and tell the story of which country has the largest and which has the least. From the graph, we can see that JPN, GRC, CAN, ITA, and BEL are the top 5 countries that have the most governmental debt over the last 8 years. Japan has the most debt across the board. From the graph, it is pretty easy to interpret that about 50% of the countries have high government debt. 

Compare to the line chart, we can't see the year-over-year growth/decline rate of the debt on the treemap. However, this graph compares the amount of debt amount countries, which tells another story. The reason to choose is that it organizes the information in an order which delivers systematic information. These two graphs use the same dataset but deliver different information which could come to a different conclusion. However, I do think that the treemap is more effective in guiding the audience to come to a quick conclusion and synthesis of the information.  

### Assignment #3 & #4 Data Visualization Critique

This assignment is about critiquing and recreating a data visualization by using Few, Stephen's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. I first chose the shareholder return v.s. market index in P&G's 2022 annual report. By using the Effectiveness Scale, I criticized the visualization using 7 metrics. Later, I started to sketch and brainstorm ways to optimize this dataset. After two rounds of interviews, I developed a new visualization to tell P&G's financial record effectively.

This process helps me to understand data visualization both from the reader's and designer's perspective to optimize the information, think about the audience, and emphasize specific insights.

### Final Project 
This is the presentation of final research and data visualization project at the end of the class. The research topic is about how the grocery food prices change over the past 10 years and how does consumer behaivor changes according to that (for example, per household spending).
