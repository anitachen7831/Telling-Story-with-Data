### Assignment #3 & #4 Data Visualization Critique

This assignment is about critiquing and recreating a data visualization by using Few, Stephen's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. I first chose the shareholder return v.s. market index in P&G's 2022 annual report. By using the Effectiveness Scale, I criticized the visualization using 7 metrics. Later, I started to sketch and brainstorm ways to optimize this dataset. After two rounds of interviews, I developed a new visualization to tell P&G's financial record effectively.

This process helps me to understand data visualization both from the reader's and designer's perspective to optimize the information, think about the audience, and emphasize specific insights.
