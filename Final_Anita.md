### Final Project

#### Project Description

As the economic recession is coming, the inflation rate is continuously growing. Consumers and their spending on groceries have been impacted greatly. The high inflation rate increases the food price, and at the same time, many companies are laying off employees or refusing to match salaries with inflation. It changes consumer spending behavior. Since food is a necessity, it is the first that is impacted. 

For this project, I am investigating the changes in consumer goods prices, especially food prices; and how that correlated with the inflation rate and consumer purchasing behavior. I gathered data from Commodity Price data from a database called Dataplanet. The data includes 45 food categories from 1996 to 2021. By analyzing the price trend, I will be able to gather the pattern of price changes in the different economic cycles. Moreover, I also gathered consumer spending per household data to analyze the relationship between price and spending. 

This story aims to interpret the consumer behavior pattern and how economic recession impact our daily life. 

#### Outline 

##### Set Up 

Egg price has increases drastically. Before I spent about $3.99 for a dozen of eggs, now for the same product, I spent about $7.99. The price almost increases twice,likewise for other products. Ultimately, average spending on grocery is increasing. How does that impact our life?

##### Conflict 
Will the price decreses as the cycle goes alone? Is that a healthy economic cycle? Who is benefiting from this inflation? If consumer spending less in grocery, what are the main categories of spending? energy?

###### diagram 6 inflation rate v.s grocery price  
Is inflation rate the only factor that drives up the commondity price? What if the corporate takes advantages of consumers' expectation that there is a price growth, in that increase the price. 


##### Resolution 
According to previous cycle, when economic recession will end? There is still hope!
