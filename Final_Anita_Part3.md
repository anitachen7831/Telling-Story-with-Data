## Skyrocketed Food Prices During the Economic Recession (Final) 

#### Write Up 

This project was inspired by my daily grocery shopping journey and observing that my grocery bill has gone up in the past few months. 
I was considering the root causes behind the skyrocketed food price and what should we do as consumers facing this 
the invisible power of price increase. 

Specifically, the story starts with an analysis of egg prices. I am an egg lover and pay a lot of attention to egg prices.
Since it is a necessary food for every household, I dived further to see how much the egg price changed. It turns out that chicken
and egg is the two products that changed the most. 

Next, I gathered consumer food index data from Data-Planet to further analyze the price change of the 10 most common grocery products
from 1996 to 2021. To make the research more relevant to the current situation, I also analyzed the price of common food items from
2021 to 2022. To have a clear and proceeding perception of how we can manage grocery budgeting and meal prep, I further segmented the data to price 
level and calories by using a quadrant graph. It is ideal for shoppers to purchase higher-calorie food at a lower price. 
Lastly, I provided 4 detailed calls to action for the audience to better manage the grocery budgeting. 

The class critique session helped me to narrow down the topic from consumer price index to grocery food price. The insights that Prof. Goranson and 
classmates provided also help to brainstorm the possible narratives and data visualization to tell the story. I made the most visual adjustment after the 
user research interview. Seeing other peers' work give me more inspiration to go out of my comfort zone and try different visual mode. 

One of the design decisions I have made that elevate my presentation is to use the Shorthand Scrollpoint Section. It helps to attract viewers' attention by 
better convincing the call to action step by step. 

#### Target Audience 
The goal of this presentation is to provide a clear understanding of what happens with consumer prices and how should we prepare 
for it. The audience of this research presentation is those who also experiencing and suffering through the drastic increase in food prices. Specially, 
I am targeting those who are curious to learn about the reasons behind the increase in prices.
The audience can be from all age levels and care about their spending.
